#' Obtain the latest parsed games, this is a good function to use if you're not picky on which
#' dates or MMR your data is, but want fast data. The latest games will always have parsed games
#' opposed to the general game list gotten from get_game_list(), wich only contains 5 - 10% parsed
#' games.
#'
#' @param num_games Min number of games you want to obtain (could get 1-10 more)
#' @param min_duration Do you want to exclude games below a certain duration threshold? We default
#'     it to 1200seconds (20 minutes), as super short games often contain early abandons and griefers.
#' @param wait_time Wait time between API calls, default to 1.00 (which is what opendota wants you
#'     to stay below, so donÂ¨t change unless you have a good reason and talked to opendota about it).
#' @param output Defaulted to "all", which will extract entire JSON, if not all, it should have the
#'     path to an R file that will be sourced and create some output, note the R file must also
#'     output to output_list()
#'
#' @return
#' @export
